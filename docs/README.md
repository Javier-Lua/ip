### **Getting Started with Your Rotom Dex!**

![Ui.png](Ui.png)

*Bzzt!* Hello, Trainer! Your very own Rotom has taken up residence in this task manager! Let's get this motor running and zap those tasks into shape. Just type your commands, and I'll handle the rest—*whirr!*

If your memory's a bit glitchy, just type `help` and I'll flash the command list back on screen!

---

### **First Steps**

1.  **Power me up!** Open the application.
2.  Let's see my specs. Type **`help`** for my full command list. *Beep-boop!*
3.  Time for my first assignment! Try something like **`todo Read that new book`**.
4.  Use commands like **`list`**, **`mark 1`**, or **`show 2025-09-20`** to see and manage your mission log.

**A Quick Note on My Circuits:**
I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so please use these formats so I don't get all scrambled:
*   For a full day: **`yyyy-MM-dd`** (e.g., `2025-09-20`)
*   For a specific time: **`yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`** (e.g., `2025-09-20 14:30`)

### **How to Add a Deadline**

*Zap!* Deadlines are my specialty. Just tell me what you need to do and when it's due.

**Just type:**
`deadline [Your Task] /by [yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm]`

**Here's a real example:**
```
deadline Finish the quarterly report /by 2025-09-20 23:59
```

**And here's what I'll say back:**
```
Got it. I've added this task:
  [D][ ] Finish the quarterly report (by: Sep 20 2025 23:59)
Now you have 5 tasks in the list.
```

### **The Command Cheat Sheet**

Here’s the full list of my functions. Don't make me say it twice! *Bzzt!*

**Scanning Your Mission Log**
*   **`list`**
    Displays your entire task list. Let's see what you've got!
*   **`show 2025-09-20`**
    Scans my database for everything happening on a specific day.
*   **`find book`**
    Initiates a search protocol for that word. It's not case-sensitive! Great for when your list gets long!

**Modifying Task Parameters**
*   **`mark 3`** / **`unmark 3`**
    Checks a task off your list (or un-checks it if you changed your mind). Use the number from the **`list`** view.
*   **`delete 2`**
    *Zap!* Permanently deletes a task from the system. Use the number from the main **`list`**.

**Uploading New Tasks**
*   **`todo Buy more coffee`**
    Logs a simple, classic to-do. *Caffeine levels low!*
*   **`deadline Send email /by 2025-09-21 10:00`**
    Logs a task with a due date and time. The clock's ticking!
*   **`event Team lunch /from 2025-09-22 12:30 /to 2025-09-22 13:30`**
    Schedules an event with a start and end time.

**System Tools**
*   **`sort`**
    Reorganizes your entire list chronologically. *Whirr!* Warning: this changes all the task numbers!
*   **`undo`**
    Whoops! Made a mistake? This will rewind my last action. My internal memory can handle a few undos in a row!
*   **`reset`**
    *Bzzt!* **WARNING:** Executes a full system wipe of your task list. Use with extreme caution!
*   **`bye`**
    Powers me down. See you later, Trainer!

### **Let's See It in Action**

**Want to see what's on your plate for a specific day?**
```
show 2025-09-20
```
I might show:
```
Tasks on 2025-09-20:
1. [D][ ] Finish report (by: Sep 20 2025 23:59)
2. [E][ ] Team Workshop (from: Sep 20 2025 14:00 to: Sep 20 2025 16:00)
```

**Finished a task? Mark it done!**
```
mark 3
```
I'll confirm:
```
Nice! I've marked this task as done:
  [T][X] Buy groceries
```

**Can't find a task? Just search for it.**
```
find report
```

### **A Few Important System Alerts**

*   **Those Numbers Matter:** The numbers used by `mark`, `unmark`, and `delete` always refer to the task's position in the full list you see when you type **`list`**. The numbers you see in a **`show`** or **`find`** results are just for that temporary view.
*   **Sorting Shuffles Everything:** Using **`sort`** will reorganize your master list. If you use numbers after sorting, they'll point to different tasks, so it's best to run **`list`** again to see the new order.
*   **Undo is Your Friend:** The **`undo`** command works for actions that change your list (adding, deleting, marking). Just looking at your list with `list` or `show` won't affect it.
*   **Auto-Save Active:** Don't worry about losing your list if you close the app. I save everything automatically! *Beep!*

### **Run into Trouble?**

*   **"Huh? I don't get that."** *Bzzt!* Syntax error! Check your spelling against my **`help`** menu.
*   **"Invalid date format."** My circuits can't parse that! Double-check you're using the format `2025-09-20` or `2025-09-20 14:30`.
*   **"That number doesn't work!"** Your task numbers might have changed. Just type **`list`** to see the current numbers I'm using.

**Remember, the best way to get help is to just type `help`! I'm right here!**
